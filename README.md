# 🔍 Steel Surface Defect Detection using YOLOv5

An AI-powered quality control system for detecting surface defects in steel manufacturing using YOLOv5 deep learning architecture.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements an automated defect detection system that can identify 6 types of steel surface defects:
- Crazing
- Inclusion  
- Patches
- Pitted Surface
- Rolled-in Scale
- Scratches

## 📊 Model Performance
- **Architecture**: YOLOv5s
- **Training Images**: 1,800+ industrial images
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ detection accuracy
- **Classes**: 6 defect types
- **Training Time**: ~4 hours on GTX 1650
